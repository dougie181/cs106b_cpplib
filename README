-----------------------------------------------------
This package contains the code for the Stanford Portable C++ library, as
described in the paper by Eric Roberts and Keith Schwarz included in the
doc directory.

The Makefile in the root directory should make a complete version of the
library on Unix-based systems or Mac OS X.  Building the .lib file for
Windows-based systems depends on what version of the operating system
and what programming environment you are using.  The sources included
in this package should compile in any standard C++ environment, but you
will need to create the necessary projects on your own.  The spl.jar
file in the java directory should work on any platform that supports
Java 5 (or a more recent version).
